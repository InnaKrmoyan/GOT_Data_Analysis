# GOT_Data_Analysis
This project consists of a set of visualizations and hypotheses about “Game of Thrones”, an American drama television series created for the HBO television network based on George R.R. Martin’s series of fantasy novels. In this report we will attempt to create useful and insightful data visualizations so that they might answer many of the questions of the fans and enthusiasts, create a better understanding of the series and overall make people interpret many factors of this television series easier. An interactive dashboard with trend charts and synchronized visual analytics components not only shows how often Game of Thrones events and characters are being mentioned by journalists and viewers, but also provides a real-time account of concepts that are being associated with the unfolding storyline and each new episode. Positive or negative sentiment is computed automatically, which sheds light on the perception of actors, new plot elements and many other factors.
